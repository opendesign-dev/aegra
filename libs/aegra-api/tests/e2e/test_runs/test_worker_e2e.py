"""E2E tests for the worker executor architecture.

These tests verify that runs execute correctly through the Redis job
queue → worker coroutine → broker pipeline, not just via in-process
asyncio tasks.  They exercise:

  - Basic run execution via worker (create → join → verify output)
  - Concurrent runs processed by multiple workers
  - Wait endpoint returning results from worker execution
  - Cancel propagation via Redis pub/sub to worker
  - Stateless run execution via worker
  - Stream reconnection after worker produces events
  - SSE client disconnect → cross-instance cancel via Redis pub/sub
