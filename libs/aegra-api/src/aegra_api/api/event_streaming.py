"""Agent Protocol v2 event streaming endpoints.

* ``POST /threads/{thread_id}/stream/events`` — SSE stream of a run's
  events, filtered by channel. Body is an ``EventStreamRequest``.
* ``POST /threads/{thread_id}/commands`` — run a thread command
  (``run.start``, ``input.respond``) and get a JSON response envelope.

Both gate on the ``FF_V2_EVENT_STREAMING`` flag + runtime capability, and
verify thread (and run) ownership before doing anything.
