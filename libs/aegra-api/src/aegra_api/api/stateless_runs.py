    """Best-effort check: did the run already publish its end event locally?

    Both broker backends set ``_finished`` whenever ``put(end)``
    (producer-side) or ``aiter()`` reading the end event (consumer-side)
    runs in this process. From the calling instance's perspective:

      - In-memory (dev): producer and consumer share this process, so
        any ``end`` event reliably flips the flag.
      - Redis (prod): if the run was picked up by a worker on another
        instance, this process never called ``put()`` — the flag flips
        only after our local pub/sub subscriber drains the end event.
        A slow-client abort that races ahead of the drain leaves the
        flag False even though the run itself terminated.

    Returning False errs on keeping the thread. The broker cleanup task
    removes the broker dict entry after an hour, but it does NOT delete
    the ephemeral thread row from Postgres — leaving an unmatched abort
    here leaks an empty ephemeral thread.

    TODO(orphan-thread-sweeper): file as a follow-up issue. The sweeper
    should periodically delete ephemeral threads (flagged via
    ``is_ephemeral`` column or metadata) where no run is in
    pending/running status and ``updated_at`` is older than a configured
    retention window. Triggering condition for accumulation: prod-mode
    Redis broker + slow-client / dead-proxy aborts that race ahead of
    the local pub/sub subscriber draining the run's end event.

    A missing broker (None) also returns False — the safe answer for
    "run not started" and "broker dict entry already swept".
