"""Drive a run through langgraph's native v3 stream for Agent Protocol v2.

``astream_events(version="v3")`` emits events already in protocol shape —
``{type:"event", method, params:{data, namespace, ...}}`` — including the
content-block message lifecycle, tool-call blocks, token usage, and
``params.interrupts``. We forward those into the broker verbatim; the
session restamps seq/event_id and filters by channel. This is the v2
counterpart to the legacy ``stream_graph_events`` (v1) producer and does
not touch it.

The only reshaping here: ``messages`` events arrive as ``[event, metadata]``
tuples, so we unwrap element 0 into ``params.data``.
